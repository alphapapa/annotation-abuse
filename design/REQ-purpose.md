# REQ-purpose
Python introduced type annotations in Python 3.5. Traditionally, a variable annotation contains the type of the variable, but it may contain any valid Python expression. The purpose of `annotation-abuse` is to illustrate some applications of storing arbitrary data in annotations.

None of the examples shown here are intended to be used in production code. Each example is best viewed as a proof of concept. The code should be documented in such a way that the unfamiliar parts of Python are made easily accessible to a beginner.
