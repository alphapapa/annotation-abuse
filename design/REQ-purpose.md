# REQ-purpose
Python introduced type hints and type annotations in Python 3.x and 3.y respectively. Traditionallya variable annotation contains the type (class) of the variable, but it may also contain a string in the case of forward references (TODO: explain what forward references are). The purpose of `annotation-abuse` is to illustrate some possible applications of treating the variable annotation as a place to store an arbitrary string.

None of the examples shown here are intended to be used in production code. Each example is best viewed as a proof of concept. The code should be documented in such a way that the unfamiliar parts of Python are made easily accessible to a beginner.
